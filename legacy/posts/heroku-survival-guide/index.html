    <h1>A Short Heroku Survival Guide</h1>
    <span class="date">28 May 2013</span>
    <p>The downside of services that promise to make
things <em>Magically Just Work</em> for you are that when things go wrong &#8211; as
inevitably they do &#8211; they go wrong in magical, unpredictable, and hard-to-debug ways.
Heroku is no exception to this rule, as Adrian Holovaty nicely
illustrates in his <a href="http://www.holovaty.com/writing/aws-notes/">recent
lament</a>
for the end of his personal Heroku honeymoon.</p>

<p>As in other areas of life, the secret to a happy and long-lasting
relationship with Heroku is to start with realistic expectations and a
willingness to put in some hard work. Whatever the brochures promise,
Heroku doesn&#8217;t allow you to forget completely about the details of
deployment. But it can, I think, offer real value over managing your own
servers &#8211; especially for small organisations without full-time
technical staff &#8211; and with the right preparation the pain and heartache can be
kept to a minimum. Below are a few tips I&#8217;ve picked up in working with
Heroku that have helped me. There&#8217;s nothing earth-shattering in here,
but maybe they&#8217;ll help you too.</p>

<h3>1. heroku run bash</h3>

<p>This simple command is, in my experience, the biggest eye-opener for
people for new to Heroku and the biggest step towards convincing them
that Heroku isn&#8217;t an entirely opaque black box. It fires up a new dyno (essentially, a new server
instance) with a copy of your deployed application and starts a shell
session.</p>

<div class="code-highlight"><pre><code>dave@carnap:~/projects/evans-io <span class="nv">$ </span>heroku run bash
Running <span class="sb">`</span>bash<span class="sb">`</span> attached to terminal... up, run.9650
~ <span class="nv">$ </span>cat /etc/lsb-release 
<span class="nv">DISTRIB_ID</span><span class="o">=</span>Ubuntu
<span class="nv">DISTRIB_RELEASE</span><span class="o">=</span>10.04
<span class="nv">DISTRIB_CODENAME</span><span class="o">=</span>lucid
<span class="nv">DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;Ubuntu 10.04 LTS&quot;</span>
~ <span class="nv">$ </span>curl http://icanhazip.com
50.16.130.216
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can then interact with this shell pretty much as you would on
any other UNIX box. In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can run as many processes as you want (within the 512MB limit)
and interact with them.</li>
<li>You can write to the filesystem and modify existing files
(although changes will only persist for the life of your session).</li>
<li>You can connect to any external service you want.</li>
<li>You can SSH out into other machines and use SCP to copy files back and forth.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few limitations of
course: you don&#8217;t have root; the Ubuntu installation you run in is pretty minimal so
you might be missing your favourite debugging tool; and incoming connections are
firewalled off. But generally speaking I&#8217;ve found that debugging in this
way isn&#8217;t much more painful than it is on your own VPS. And it&#8217;s
certainly an awful lot better than desperately deploying hundreds of tiny commits
while tailing Heroku&#8217;s log output and wondering what the hell is going
on (we&#8217;ve all been there)!</p>

<p>Incidentally, this might be one of the few situations where mastery of
(or at least minimal competence with) the venerable <code>ed</code> editor might
actually come in handy for the modern developer as neither <code>vi</code> or <code>nano</code>
is available in the standard Heroku environment. You won&#8217;t
want to do much serious coding with it, but if you just need to tweak
a few config values then it&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/actually-using-ed/">not too
hard</a> to get the basics.</p>

<h3>2. Get to know your buildpack</h3>

<p>Most of the really nasty magic in Heroku is not in the runtime
environment but in the buildpacks: the code responsible for taking a git
checkout of your application code and producing a &#8220;slug&#8221; (a filesystem
snapshot) with everything needed to run your application. Fortunately,
the buildpack repositories are freely accessible on
<a href="https://github.com/search?q=heroku-buildpack+user%3Aheroku&amp;ref=searchresults&amp;type=Repositories">GitHub</a> 
and are fairly short and easy to read.</p>

<p>You can read the full details of the Buildpack API
<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpack-api">here</a> (there&#8217;s
very little to it), but most of the action happens in the
<em>compile</em> phase. On GitHub, find the buildpack for whichever platform
you&#8217;re running on and open the <code>bin/compile</code> file. You&#8217;ll find a script
(almost certainly bash) whose job is to take your source code and
produce a self-contained application, packaged up with all its
dependencies and ready to run.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really worth the time to scan through this script and get a sense
of what it&#8217;s up to. This is where the dirtiest hacks live (“if this
version of this dependency is specified then rename this file and set
this special environment variable”) and having an idea of what these are
will give you a useful starting point when things start going
wrong.</p>

<h3>3. Pin your buildpack version</h3>

<p>Having your latest deploy break mysteriously, not because of any changes
you&#8217;ve made but because Heroku silently changed the buildpack out from
under you, is an incredibly frustrating experience. Fortunately, it&#8217;s
easy to make sure this never happens.</p>

<p>First, find the appropriate
buildpack on GitHub and copy the read-only repository URL. For the
Python buildpack, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python.git
</code></pre>

<p>Next, copy the SHA of the latest commit (there&#8217;s a handy link for this
on the main repository page) and add it to the end of the git URL,
preceded by a hash, like this:</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python.git#23493302e665dc2428f388654a1d13fd4d437b7a
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, tell Heroku to use this specific version of this buildpack when
deploying your application:</p>

<pre><code>heroku config:set \
 BUILDPACK_URL='https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python.git#23493302e665dc2428f388654a1d13fd4d437b7a'
</code></pre>

<p>You&#8217;ll probably want to &#8220;watch&#8221; the repository on GitHub so you get
automatic notifications when it&#8217;s updated and can update the
BUILDPACK_URL with the new commit SHA. It&#8217;s a little bit more effort
than letting Heroku update it automatically, but not much. And now, when your latest
deployment falls flat on its face, at least you know it was probably
your fault.</p>

<h3>4. Set up Heroku error alerting</h3>

<p>Heroku errors occur at a different level from application errors and so
won&#8217;t be caught by your application&#8217;s standard error handling and
notification machinery.
However, if your application suddenly starts being killed for
hitting its memory limits you really want to know about it. It takes a
minute to set up the free version of the <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/logentries">LogEntries
add-on</a> which will send email
notifications whenever one of these Heroku errors occurs. Do it now.</p>

<h3>Any other suggestions?</h3>

<p>Those are my four simple tips. If you&#8217;ve found them helpful, or if
you&#8217;ve got suggestions of your own
to add, please get in touch.</p>
